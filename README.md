This is a small GUI that allows the user to select tiles, and paste them at a desired location.
The focus was first set on the architecture: how can I build an app that I can expand and
modify at will?
The second objective would be to be able to select tiles by the way of a console prompt, in 
order to be able to do without the selector on the left.
Still later on, characters will be introduced etc.
The makefile needs to be restructured.
A database connection is at the time of writing this README (21.02.26) in the process of being
created.
Some workflows (CI/CD pipelines, most notably) will be integrated to the project.
